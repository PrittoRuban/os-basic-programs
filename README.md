## Overview

This repository contains various C programs related to operating system concepts, including scheduling algorithms, process synchronization, and more. Each program can be compiled and executed independently.

## Getting Started

To use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrittoRuban/os-basic-programs.git
   cd os-basic-programs
   ```

2. **Install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):**
   Make sure you have GCC installed on your system. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   gcc --version
   ```
   If it's not installed, you can install it using your package manager.

## Usage

To compile and execute any of the C programs, use the following commands:

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   gcc <filename>.c
   ```

2. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the program you want to run (e.g., `bankersalgo.c`, `fcfs.c`, etc.).
